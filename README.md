# Quick Poll

This is simple 3-page web application that I created in order to learn the ember.js library. Quick Poll (as the name implies) it's really simple. The home page prompts you to enter the question of your poll and up to three options to answer the poll. Then just click the create button and shazaaamm.

## Wiki
As I explained in the intro, I made this app in order to learn ember.js so I kept a nicely written wiki page to keep track of everything and some notes about ember.js overall.
